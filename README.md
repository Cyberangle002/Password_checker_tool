# Password_checker_tool
This Python code defines a function check_password_strength() that evaluates the strength of a given password based on specific criteria. It checks whether the password meets the following conditions for a strong password:

Length Check: The password should be at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase Letter: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
Lowercase Letter: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
Digit: The password must contain at least one digit (0-9).
Special Character: The password must include at least one special character, such as !@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>.
How the Code Works:
Input: The program takes a password input from the user.
Checking Criteria: The function uses regular expressions and Python's built-in string methods to check each of the above conditions:
For the length, it compares the password length with 8.
It checks for uppercase letters with any(char.isupper() for char in password).
It checks for lowercase letters with any(char.islower() for char in password).
It checks for digits using any(char.isdigit() for char in password).
It checks for special characters using a regular expression re.search(r"[!@#$%^&*(),.?\":{}|<>]", password).
Feedback: If any condition fails, the password is deemed weak, and the program prints the criteria that the user failed to meet. Otherwise, it prints a message saying the password is strong.
xample Output:
Weak Password: If the password doesn't meet one or more of the conditions, it will print specific instructions to improve the password.
Strong Password: If all conditions are satisfied, it will print "Strong Password!"
Example:
plaintext
Copy code
Enter a password to check its strength: password123
Weak Password! Consider the following:
- Password should be at least 8 characters long.
- Include at least one uppercase letter.
- Include at least one special character (!@#$%^&*(), etc.).
Purpose:
This function helps users evaluate the strength of their passwords and provides clear instructions on how to improve them based on common password security requirements.
